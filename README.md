# Minor-Project
Our project will mainly focus on  DATA SCIENCE, DATA ANALYSIS and MACHINE LEARNING using a set of tools and technologies that are required for development of large-scale architectures.
While one may argue that the same thing could have been done using 
big data, but that’s where the real catch is. 

As it is already mentioned that the tools and architecture we’ll be using mainly focus on large scale deployments.

It’s been a fairly long period since humans started computing and then extracting useful insights from the data, but in past decade the immense growth in data has posed a serious challenge for computing that’s where big data came and with time we also acquired the capacity to process real time massive data sets and ever since it’s just keeps growing bigger and bigger.

In our project we’ll be looking at architecture of real time data pipeline and 
We’ll also look at analysis of big data using spark mlib.

We will be using different machine learning algorithms like SVM, Polynomial regression and Bayesain Ridge Regression in order to gain best results and predictions of this global pandemic.

Here we assume that the data provided is accurate and won’t change with time under this covid 19 outbreak to hamper the prediction.
